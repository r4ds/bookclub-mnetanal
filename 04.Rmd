A **network** is a catalog of a system's components often called *nodes* or *vertices* and the direct interactions between them, called *links* or *edges.* This representation, also known as **graph,** offers a common language to study systems of different natures and scales.[^-5]

**Network analysis** focuses on patterns of relations between nodes.

Examples of network analysis domains:

-   Study the *structure* of affective *links* between persons

-   Study *flows* of commodities between organizations.

-   Find *shared* members between social movement organizations.

-   Study *shared* needles between drug users.

What is common across these domains is an emphasis on the **structure of relations**, which serves to link micro- and macro-level processes.

## Vectors, matrices and data.frames

**Vectors** are collection of elements of the same type without dimensions. Vectors of length 1 are called **scalars**.

```{r}
scalar_1 <- 1
scalar_2 <- 2
scalar_3 <- 3
length(scalar_1) #length of a the scalar is 1
```

```{r}
(vector_123 <- c(scalar_1, scalar_2, scalar_3))
(vector_long <- c(vector_123, vector_123))
dim(vector_123) #dimensions of the vector returns NULL
```

Scalars come in four different types

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(1.5)
typeof(1L)
typeof("one")
```

R can serve as a calculator.

```{r}
#basic mathematical operations
scalar_1+scalar_2
scalar_3^scalar_2
```

Computations on vectors are performed element-wise.

```{r}
vector_123*scalar_2
```

Functions in R have names. A basic function is `print()`.

```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```

`log()` is another useful function and it has two arguments, x and base.

```{r}
#order matters if arguments are not specified 
log(8, base = 2)
log(x = 8, base = 2)
log(8, 2)
log(base = 2, x = 8)
log(2, 8)
```

Another important function is `sample()` that takes a sample from a vector.

```{r}
sample(1:5, 3) #random sample without replacement
sample(1:5, 3, replace = TRUE) #random sample with replacement
sample(1:5, 3, prob = c(0.2,0.1,0.3,0.1,0.3)) #odd-biased sample without replacement
```

A **matrix** is just a vector with dimensions.

```{r}
#adding dimensions to a vector transforms it to matrix
vector_long_2 <- vector_long
identical(vector_long, vector_long_2)
(dim(vector_long_2) <- c(2,3))
identical(vector_long, vector_long_2)
dim(vector_long)
dim(vector_long_2)
```

Matrices can be created using the `matrix()` function.

```{r}
matrix(vector_long, 2, 3)
```

The default for `matrix()` function is to fill values by-column. This can changed by setting `byrow` to TRUE

```{r}
matrix(vector_long, 2, 3, byrow = TRUE)
```

Example: Simulate an adjacency matrix for a network[^-6]

[^-6]: For undirected graphs, adjacency matrix is symmetric for one-mode network. This symmerty might not hold for two-mode AKA bipartite networks. In case of directed graphs the adjacency matrix can be asymmetric to reflect directionality of the link/edge. (Thanks Pierre Olivier for your input)

```{r}
set.seed(1992)
#1 = link,0 = no-link
x <- sample(c(1,0), 25, replace = TRUE, prob=c(.5,.5))
#names of the network's nodes
dim_names <- list(c("Thea", "Pravin", "Troy", "Albin", "Clementine"),
                  c("Thea", "Pravin", "Troy", "Albin", "Clementine"))
#creat 5x5 adjacency matix
(matrix_data2 <- matrix(x,
                        nrow=5, 
                        ncol=5,
                        byrow =TRUE,
                        dimnames = dim_names)#set names of the rows and columns
  )

isSymmetric(matrix_data2)
```

A **data.frame** is a collection of vectors of the same length. We can convert a matrix into a **data.frame** and vice versa.

```{r}
#convert matrix to dataframe
class(matrix_data2)

df_data2 <- as.data.frame(matrix_data2)
class(df_data2)
```

-   data.frames are inefficient in R and are increasingly being replaced by user-created data classes, such as data.table.[^-7]

-   Another important data structure that you need to familiarize yourself with if you're new to R is **lists**

[^-7]: adjacency matrix , especially large ones, are recommended to be stored as sparse matrix for memory efficiency.

## Indexing and Subsetting

Subsetting works by using indices of interest with square brackets.

In matrix, using a single index treats it as a vector and selects the cells based on their order

```{r}
matrix_data2
matrix_data2[c(1,7,20,25)]
```

Using two indices subsets the matrix based on [row,column] pairs

```{r}
matrix_data2[1,4]
matrix_data2[c(1,2),c(4,5)]
```

We can also subset based on the column/row names

```{r}
matrix_data2["Thea", "Troy"]
```

We can use subsetting to change specific cells in the matrix

```{r}
matrix_data2[c(1,7,20,25)] <- 7
matrix_data2

matrix_data2[c(1,2),c(4,5)] <- 9
matrix_data2
```

Subsetting in dataframe using a single index works differently.

```{r}
#select columns 1, 2, and 3
df_data2[c(1,2,3)]
```

Finally, we may wish to remove columns in a data.frame, matrix or vector. We can use the `subset` function to do this.

```{r}
#
(subset( vector_123, vector_123 > 1))
(vector_123[vector_123>1])

```

## Loading Packages

-   Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code.

-   **igraph** is collection of network analysis tools with the emphasis on efficiency, portability and ease of use

-   

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggraph",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

The library function tells R to add the package to the current R session

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(igraph))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggraph))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidygraph))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

```{r}
matrix_data2 %>%
  graph.adjacency(mode = "undirected")%>%
  plot()
```

```{r}
tbl_links <- matrix_data2 %>%
  graph.adjacency()%>%
  get.edgelist() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  dplyr::rename(from = "V1", to = "V2")
  
tbl_nodes <- data.frame(name = tbl_links %>% unlist %>% unique())%>%
  as_tibble()

graph <- graph_from_data_frame(tbl_links, tbl_nodes, directed = FALSE)

graph %>%
  ggraph()+
  geom_edge_link() + 
  geom_node_point()+ 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 8)

```
