# Transitivity, Structural Balance, and Hierarchy

**Learning objectives:**

-   Understand microfoundations (motifs) of networks (dyads, triads).
-   Learn the basic functions for measuring reciprocity, transitivity, the triad census,

## Load the data

```{r}
# read in the edge list from our github
el <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahoffman/stanford_networks/main/data/comm59.dat.txt", header = T)
# Read in attributes from our github
attributes <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahoffman/stanford_networks/main/data/comm59_att.dat.txt", header = T)
# add an ID column
attributes$ID <- 1:nrow(attributes)
```

```{r}
# Indexing data so that you only put in certain columns
el_no_weight <- el[,1:2] # We will ignore the ranking variable for now.
colnames(el_no_weight) <- c("from", "to")

el_no_weight <- as.matrix(el_no_weight) # igraph requires a matrix

# convert ids to characters so they are preserved as names
el_no_weight <- apply(el_no_weight,2,as.character)

# Graph the network
net59 <- graph.edgelist(el_no_weight, directed = T)

# Finally, add attributes  
# First link vertex names to their place in the attribute dataset
linked_ids <- match(V(net59)$name, attributes$ID)

# Then we can use that to assign a variable to each user in the network
V(net59)$race <- attributes$race[linked_ids]
V(net59)$sex <- attributes$sex[linked_ids]
V(net59)$grade <- attributes$grade[linked_ids]
V(net59)$school <- attributes$school[linked_ids]

## The Dyad

-   large social networks can be broken down into their constituent parts called "motifs".
-   The most basic motif consists of only two nodes and is called a dyad.
-   A dyad can have different configurations based on the graph type :
    -   Undirected: connected or disconnected.
    -   Directed: mutual, assymetric, and null.

Transitivity:

-   Number of existing triplets (triangles x 3) divided by all possible triplets.

-   A measure of the tendency of the nodes to cluster together.

-   "A friend of a friend is a friend"

-   related to clustering coefficient and modularity

Since edges in a network signify the presence or absence of dyadic relations, we can think of network density as a measure of the proportion of present dyads over the number of all possible dyads.

```{r}
graph.density(net59)
```

-   In directed graphs, an edge is reciprocal when ego and alter send each other ties.
-   Reciprocity is measures the tendency for edges to be reciprocal across the whole network.

```{r}
reciprocity(net59)
```

3- Generating a random graph for comparison - Random graph is characterized by chance of a tie is determined by chance and independent from one another. - Random graph can be used as a null model to test our data.

In an erdos.renyi.graph, each edge has the same probability of being created

```{r}
#igraph has a fast and easy function for generating random graphs.
?erdos.renyi.game
```

Let's calculate the density and number of nodes in our graph.

```{r}
net59_n <- vcount(net59)
net59_density <- graph.density(net59)
```

Then use them as parameters to generate a random graph

```{r}
random_graph <- erdos.renyi.game(n = net59_n,# n is the number of nodes
                                 p.or.m = net59_density,#probability of drawing an edge
                                 directed = TRUE) # whether the network is directed or not

```

```{r}
plot(random_graph,  
     vertex.size = 2, 
     vertex.label = NA, 
     edge.curved = .1, 
     vertex.color = "tomato", 
     edge.arrow.size = .1, 
     edge.width = .5, 
     edge.color = "grey60")
```

Let's compare the reciprocity of the random graph to our graph

```{r}
reciprocity(random_graph)
reciprocity(net59)
```

## The Triad

-   Triads consist of three nodes and are therefore more complex than dyads, with more possible arrangements.
-   Triad census calculates how many triads there are of each type
-   In an undirected graph, there are 8 possible triads
-   In a directed graph, there are 16 possible triads

## Calculating a triad census

```{r}
triad.census(net59)

```

```{r}
triad.census(random_graph)

```

## Random graphs galore

One problem is that we are basing our analysis on a single random graph. Because edges are drawn randomly, there is a lot of variation in the structure of random graphs, especially when the number of nodes in the graph is small (less than one thousand).

What we really want is a distribution of random graphs and their triad censuses, against which our own could be compared. So let's generate one hundred random graphs, and create a distribution of random graph triad censuses and see where our graph lies on that distribution

```{r}
trial <- vector("list", 100) # this creates a list with 100 spaces to store things.  We will store each result here. 

trial <- lapply(seq(100), function(x){
  random_graph <- erdos.renyi.game(n = net59_n, p.or.m = net59_density, directed = TRUE) 
  triad.census(random_graph)
})


trial_df <- do.call("rbind", trial) # We can use the do.call and "rbind" functions together to combine all of the results into a matrix, where each row is one of our trials

colnames(trial_df) <- c("003", "012", "102", "021D", "021U", "021C", "111D", "111U", "030T", "030C", "201", "120D", "120U", "120C", "210", "300") # It is worth naming the columns too.

trial_df_w_observed <- rbind(trial_df, as.numeric(triad.census(net59))) # add in the observed results
```

```{r}
# First, standardize all of the columns by dividing each of their values by the largest value in that column, so that each will be on a similar scale (0 to 1), we can visualize them meaningfully 
trial_df_w_observed <- as.data.frame(trial_df_w_observed)

trial_df_w_observed[,1:ncol(trial_df_w_observed)] <- sapply(trial_df_w_observed[,1:length(trial_df_w_observed)], function(x) x/max(x))

# Then split the observed from the simulation results
trial_df <- as.data.frame(trial_df_w_observed[1:100,])
observed <- as.numeric(trial_df_w_observed[101,])

# Summarize the simulation results and add the observed data set back in for comparison
summarized_stats <- data.frame(TriadType = colnames(trial_df), 
                               Means = sapply(trial_df, mean), 
                               LowerCI = sapply(trial_df, function(x) quantile(x, 0.05)),
                               UpperCI = sapply(trial_df, function(x) quantile(x, 0.95)), 
                               Observed = observed) 

summarized_stats
```

```{r}
ggplot(summarized_stats) + 
    geom_point(aes(x=TriadType, y=Means, colour=TriadType)) + 
    geom_errorbar(aes(x = TriadType, ymin=LowerCI, ymax=UpperCI, colour=TriadType), width=.1) +
    geom_point(aes(x=TriadType, y=Observed, colour="Observed")) +
    coord_flip()
```

## Producing a tau statistic

```{r}
weighting_scheme <- c(0,0,0,1,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0)

sum(triad.census(net59) * weighting_scheme)
```
